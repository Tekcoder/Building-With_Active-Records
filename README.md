# Micro-Reddit Project from Microverse

This project puts your knowledge of active record, models, and associations to the tests. You will build an application similar to Reddit (called Micro-Reddit) where a user can create a post and add comments to it.

In this project, you’ll build the data structures necessary to support link submissions and commenting. We won’t build a front end for it because we don’t need to… you can use the Rails console to play around with models without the overhead of making HTTP requests and involving controllers or views.

## Installation

    git clone url
    cd micro-reddit
    bundle install
    rails server
